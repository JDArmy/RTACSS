    "description": "The Red Team Assessment Scoring System (RTASS) is an open framework used to assess the capability investment of both offensive and defensive sides in a single cyber red-blue confrontation or actual combat exercise, as well as the degree of risk faced by the business and the enterprise involved. Through RTASS, it is possible to quantify the risk status of attackers, defenders, business parties and enterprises in the red-blue adversarial network attack and defense drills. This framework is suitable for security assessment scenarios that conduct real network attacks on enterprises by simulating hacker APT methods, such as network red-blue confrontation drills, network actual offensive and defensive exercises, red team assessments, and blue army assessments.",
